# This is responsive width and height for react native

It's easy to use for create responsive size for react native. This is step by step for using this package

`npm install crs-responsive-size`

and for using this, you just need to type like this

```JS
import {responsiveWidth, responsiveHeight} from 'crs-responsive-size'


(example)
<View style={{width:responsiveWidth(200), height:responsiveHeight(200)}}>

</View>
```

But if you want to create square, you need use same width or height. Because it based on your width or height device. Here's for example

```JS
<View style={{width:responsiveWidth(200), height:responsiveWidth(200)}}>
</View>
```
